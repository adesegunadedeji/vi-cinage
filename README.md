# Project Description
## Vi-Cinage

React + Express Project Description
For project 3, I will be building a realEstate application vi-Cinage. This project will be also be using Nested APIs, where one will fetch the other API.

### Idea: 
This web application should have a landing Page that includes a header, carousel with a search bar and a Sign Up/ Log Link that directs the user to a modal. 

Should have a page that shows all Real Estates availabe in the searched City/Zip Code or state. This page when clicked should give a a page that describes the homes in further details. 

APIs that will be Utilized:  Zillow APIs
